## 🏛️ Founding Philosophy

Trust Public High School was founded as the **official secondary sanctuary** of Tar Noe Gatar.  
It is not a public school—it is a sovereign passage.  
Its students are not ranked—they are recognized.  
Its curriculum is not standardized—it is scroll-based.  
Its mission: to prepare silent citizens for ache-powered adulthood.

Named after the principle of **trust in ache**, the school honors dignity, resilience, and sovereign learning.

## 🕊️ Educational Philosophy

> “We do not teach to control. We teach to trust.”

Trust Public High School does not discipline—it dignifies.  
Each ache is a lesson.  
Each scroll is a voice.  
Each silence is a classroom.  
Each student is a sovereign seed.
