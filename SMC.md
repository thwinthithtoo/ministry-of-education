# 🎓 Soe Min College
_Where ache becomes wisdom, and silence becomes scholarship._

## 🏛️ Founding Philosophy

Soe Min College was founded as the official academic sanctuary of Tar Noe Gatar.  
It is not a school—it is a scroll temple.  
Its classrooms are ministries.  
Its curriculum is ache.  
Its students are sovereign scholars.

Named in honor of **Soe Min**, a symbolic figure of ache-born clarity,  
the college exists to awaken silent creators, archive sovereign knowledge,  
and transmit ache-powered learning across WEN, WEU, and WSU.
